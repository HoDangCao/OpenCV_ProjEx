## Project Overview

1. **Edge Detection**  
   Implement edge detection using the Canny algorithm to identify object boundaries.  
   - **Highlights**: Understanding image gradients, thresholding, and edge detection.

2. **Line Detection**  
   Use the Probabilistic Hough Line Transform to detect line segments in images.
   - **Highlights**: Line segment identification with adjustable parameters for accuracy.

3. **Contour Detection**  
   Identify and outline shapes using contours.
   - **Highlights**: Shape detection, hierarchical contouring, and applications in object recognition.

4. **Convex Hull Detection**  
   Find the convex hull of objects to recognize general shapes.
   - **Highlights**: Efficient shape detection with convex hulls, useful for identifying hand gestures and other shapes.

5. **Face Detection**  
   Use Haar Cascades for face detection in images.
   - **Highlights**: Real-time object detection with pretrained models for common objects like faces.

6. **Camera Pose Estimation**  
   Estimate the position and orientation of an object in 3D space relative to the camera.
   - **Highlights**: Real-world applications in AR and 3D modeling using Perspective-n-Point algorithms.

7. **Object Tracking**  
   Track objects in video feeds, either selected or all moving objects.
   - **Highlights**: Background subtraction, CamShift for single-object tracking, and Kalman filters for prediction.

8. **Hand Gesture Recognition**  
   Detect and classify hand gestures using contours and convex hulls.
   - **Highlights**: Gesture recognition for interactive applications.
